### SCALE SD Innovation Program 2020: Citizen Engagement in the Arts
The challenge at the [SCALE SD Innovation Program 2020](https://www.scalesd.com/innovation-2020/) is to develop and
design a digital engagement platform where the public can contribute ideas about arts, culture and creativity and help map San Diego's cultural assets.

We showcased the concept of MAP IT, winning the Most Implementable Solution award at the Innovation Weekend.

### Solution
[MAP IT](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vRzBhmSWf5Z9x0Nd5_pRhii4O1AQUa12k_24y1USsig/edit?usp=sharing) is an app to crowdsource and map cultural assets in the city.

#### Features
- MAP IT creates unconventional immersive routes based on walkable areas and public transport
- Users add cultural landmarks to their journey and can share their route
- Users gain rewards for completing cultural asset geo-caching challenges
- Businesses and artists can add themed routes
