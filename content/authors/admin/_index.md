I'm an experienced data scientist with a PhD in Psychology and expertise in machine learning, data analytics, experiment
design, and complex datasets. In my past positions I have strategically built out data science departments to create
business value and refine products.

Previously, I did research on the physiology and detection of developmental disorders such as autism in African populations.

In my free time I swing a sword haphazardly during tai chi sessions.
