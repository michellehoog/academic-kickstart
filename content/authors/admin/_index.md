I am a behavioral data scientist interested in tech education, health care and youth employment.

At Umuzi, a nonprofit organization training un(der)employed youth in digital careers, I founded and scaled the Data Science department, going from 3 to 30 students in the space of a year. Currently I am creating a health tech startup to help community health workers detect childhood disabilities and delays in low-income areas.

Previously, I did research on the physiology and detection of developmental disorders such as autism in African populations.

In my free time I swing a sword haphazardly during tai chi sessions.
